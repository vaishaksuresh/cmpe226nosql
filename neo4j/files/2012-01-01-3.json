This means using WebDriverJs in the browser will only be supported by WebKit, Firefox, IE8+, and Opera 12+.\n\nUnfortunately, the various browser implementations of CORS are not consistent:\n* IE's XDomainRequest object may only generate requests that could be generated using a HTML form. This means it cannot generate the DELETE requests required by the JsonWireProtocol.\n* WebKit's implementation of CORS does not follow the spec and forbids redirects.\n* If the server returns an error response (e.g., 4xx or 5xx), IE and Opera's implementations will fire the on error handler, but without the server's response text. This renders IE and Opera incapable of handling command failures in the standard JSON protocol.\n\nTo work around this issues, I've defined a single end-point on the server to handle all CORS-based requests: /xdrpc (cross-domain rpc).  This end-point accepts POST requests with a JSON body of the form  {method:string, path:string, data:!Object}\nThe server will decode the command in the request body and route it to the correct command handler. The command response will always be returned as a standard JSON response object: {status:number, value:*}.  The response will always be sent with a 200 response, so clients must rely on the response's \"status\" field to determine whether the command succeeded.\n\nThis has been tested against Chrome, Firefox, IE, and Opera Next (12.0a)\n\n\n\n\ngit-svn-id: https://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@15330 07704840-8298-11de-bf8c-fd130f914ac9"},{"sha":"350d469d4fa6f3799768e8221f1ae8a6b1ec0179","author":{"email":"jmleyba@07704840-8298-11de-bf8c-fd130f914ac9","name":"jmleyba"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Selenium2/Selenium2/commits/350d469d4fa6f3799768e8221f1ae8a6b1ec0179","message":"JasonLeyba: Remove TODO addressed in r15331.\n\n\ngit-svn-id: https://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk@15333 07704840-8298-11de-bf8c-fd130f914ac9"}],"head":"350d469d4fa6f3799768e8221f1ae8a6b1ec0179","size":2},"actor":{"login":"Selenium2","id":564176,"url":"https://api.github.dev/users/Selenium2","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9aa15bd565d4cd32b424421d33a94998?d=http://github.dev%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"9aa15bd565d4cd32b424421d33a94998"},"public":true,"id":"1508519352"}

It's up to the developer to stream the\nresponse content from the callback with standard PHP functions like echo.\nYou can also use flush() if needed.\n\nFrom a controller, do something like this:\n\n    $twig = $this->get('templating');\n\n    return new StreamedResponse(function () use ($templating) {\n        $templating->stream('BlogBundle:Annot:streamed.html.twig');\n    }, 200, array('Content-Type' => 'text/html'));\n\nIf you are using the base controller, you can use the stream() method instead:\n\n    return $this->stream('BlogBundle:Annot:streamed.html.twig');\n\nYou can stream an existing file by using the PHP built-in readfile() function:\n\n    new StreamedResponse(function () use ($file) {\n        readfile($file);\n    }, 200, array('Content-Type' => 'image/png');\n\nRead http://php.net/flush for more information about output buffering in PHP.\n\nNote that you should do your best to move all expensive operations to\nbe \"activated/evaluated/called\" during template evaluation.\n\nTemplates\n---------\n\nIf you are using Twig as a template engine, everything should work as\nusual, even if are using template inheritance!\n\nHowever, note that streaming is not supported for PHP templates. Support\nis impossible by design (as the layout is rendered after the main content).\n\nExceptions\n----------\n\nExceptions thrown during rendering will be rendered as usual except that\nsome content might have been rendered already.\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\nAs the getContent() method always returns false for streamed Responses, some\nevent listeners won't work at all:\n\n* Web debug toolbar is not available for such Responses (but the profiler works fine);\n* ESI is not supported.\n\nAlso note that streamed responses cannot benefit from HTTP caching for obvious\nreasons.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby Seldaek at 2011/12/21 06:34:13 -0800\n\nJust an idea: what about exposing flush() to twig? Possibly in a way that it will not call it if the template is not streaming. That way you could always add a flush() after your </head> tag to make sure that goes out as fast as possible, but it wouldn't mess with non-streamed responses. Although it appears flush() doesn't affect output buffers, so I guess it doesn't need anything special.\n\nWhen you say \"ESI is not supported.\", that means only the AppCache right? I don't see why this would affect Varnish, but then again as far as I know Varnish will buffer if ESI is used so the benefit of streaming there is non-existent.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby cordoval at 2011/12/21 08:04:21 -0800\n\nwonder what the use case is for streaming a response, very interesting.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby johnkary at 2011/12/21 08:19:48 -0800\n\n@cordoval Common use cases are present fairly well by this RailsCast video: http://railscasts.com/episodes/266-http-streaming\n\nEssentially it allows faster fetching of web assets (JS, CSS, etc) located in the &lt;head>&lt;/head>, allowing those assets to be fetched as soon as possible before the remainder of the content body is computed and sent to the browser. The end goal is to improve page load speed.\n\nThere are other uses cases too like making large body content available quickly to the service consuming it. Think if you were monitoring a live feed of JSON data of newest Twitter comments.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby lsmith77 at 2011/12/21 08:54:35 -0800\n\nHow does this relate the limitations mentioned in:\nhttp://yehudakatz.com/2010/09/07/automatic-flushing-the-rails-3-1-plan/\n\nAm I right to understand that due to how twig works we are not really streaming the content pieces when we call render(), but instead the entire template with its layout is rendered and only then will we flush? or does it mean that the render call will work its way to the top level layout template and form then on it can send the content until it hits another block, which it then first renders before it continues to send the data?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby stof at 2011/12/21 09:02:53 -0800\n\n@lsmith77 this is why the ``stream`` method calls ``display`` in Twig instead of ``render``. ``display`` uses echo to print the output of the template line by line (and blocks are simply method calls in the middle). Look at your compiled templates to see it (the ``doDisplay`` method)\nRendering a template with Twig simply use an output buffer around the rendering.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby fabpot at 2011/12/21 09:24:33 -0800\n\n@lsmith77: We don't have the Rails problem thanks to Twig as the order of execution is the right one by default (the layout is executed first); it means that we can have the flush feature without any change to how the core works. As @stof mentioned, we are using `display`, not `render`, so we are streaming your templates for byte one.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby fabpot at 2011/12/21 09:36:41 -0800\n\n@Seldaek: yes, I meant ESI with the PHP reverse proxy.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby fabpot at 2011/12/21 09:37:34 -0800\n\n@Seldaek: I have `flush()` support for Twig on my todo-list. As you mentioned, It should be trivial to implement.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby fzaninotto at 2011/12/21 09:48:18 -0800\n\nHow do streaming responses deal with assets that must be called in the head, but are declared in the body?\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby fabpot at 2011/12/21 09:52:12 -0800\n\n@fzaninotto: What do you mean?\n\nWith Twig, your layout is defined with blocks (\"holes\"). These blocks are overridden by child templates, but evaluated as they are encountered in the layout. So, everything works as expected.\n\nAs noted in the commit message, this does not work with PHP templates for the problems mentioned in the Rails post (as the order of execution is not the right one -- the child template is first evaluated and then the layout).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby fzaninotto at 2011/12/21 10:07:35 -0800\n\nI was referring to using Assetic. Not sure if this compiles to Twig the same way as javascript and stylesheet blocks placed in the head - and therefore executed in the right way.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby fabpot at 2011/12/21 10:34:59 -0800\n\n@Seldaek: I've just added a `flush` tag in Twig 1.5: https://github.com/fabpot/Twig/commit/1d6dfad4f55c721ec7b6e674ef225b8442bce896\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nby catchamonkey at 2011/12/21 13:29:22 -0800\n\nI'm really happy you've got this into the core, it's a great feature to have!

The first thing the subroutine\ndid was GetMarcBiblio, and the $biblionumber passed was never used again.\n\nThis subroutine was only used 3 places: opac/opac-search.pl, opac/opac-detail.pl,\nand C4/VirtualShelves/Page.pm.  In the first and last cases, it was used in a loop.\nIn the last two cases, a call to GetMarcBiblio had already been done.  This is expensive, and\nwe were doing it twice per record.\n\nFor opac/opac-search.pl, the call to GetMarcBiblio was moved to just outside GetCOinSBiblio;\nthis will not change the performance at all.  But for opac/opac-detail.pl and C4/VirtualShelves/Page.pm,\na redudant call to GetMarcBiblio is now avoided.\n\nTo Test:\n1. Enable COinSinOPACResults in system preferences.  Perform a search in the OPAC.\n   Verify that the COinS spans are showing up\n2. View the detail record of one of the returned items.  Confirm that the COinS span exists on the detail page.\n3.

(This comes from an [unintentional] additional\nupdate statement in DelItem.) It makes deletion time visible.\nIn the past, the marcxml was updated too at that moment, resulting in an\nupdated timestamp in biblioitems too. The timestamp in biblio was not touched.\n\nIf you delete a biblio however, the timestamps in deletedbiblio and\ndeletedbiblioitems do not reflect time of deletion. They still show the time of\nlast update before the record was deleted. This last update can be extracted\nfrom MARC field 005 too.\n\nThis behavior is not consistent nor logical. I would suggest to add a statement\nin DelBiblio to force updating the timestamp in deletedbiblio(items) too. It\nmakes the time of deletion visible in the record too.

Completely remove the struct type\n'Config' in putty.h, which stores all PuTTY's settings and includes an\narbitrary length limit on every single one of those settings which is\nstored in string form.

Everywhere that a Config was previously\nused, a Conf is now; everywhere there was a Config structure copy,\nconf_copy() is called; every lookup, adjustment, load and save\noperation on a Config has been rewritten; and there's a mechanism for\nserialising a Conf into a binary blob and back for use with Duplicate\nSession.\n\nUser-visible effects of this change _should_ be minimal, though I\ndon't doubt I've introduced one or two bugs here and there which will\neventually be found.

I find the documentation's claim that Discrete is somehow inherently discrete dubious; apart from `changes`, the interface of Discretes is identical to that of Behaviors. Which to choose basically comes down to\r\n\r\n1. Optimisation, and\r\n2. Interfacing with the outside world.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, these concerns and their manifestation as Behavior vs. Discrete collide to make code less declarative, harder to structure, and harder to understand. So I went through working code using reactive-banana: the reactive-banana-wx examples.\r\n\r\nIn [Arithmetic.hs](https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana/blob/master/reactive-banana-wx/src/Arithmetic.hs), Behaviors are only used to poll the state of a text box in reaction to events.\r\n\r\nIn [Asteroids.hs](https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana/blob/master/reactive-banana-wx/src/Asteroids.hs), Behaviors are used for the game state. `bship` does not use Behaviors from the outside world, and I think it could be made Discrete without losing anything. `brocks` uses a `brandom` Behavior to poll the RNG from the outside world. However, it is only consulted in response to the `etick` Event. (Incidentally, I'm not sure an RNG is a proper Behavior like this; the act of observing it changes it, and nothing else does (barring other threads accessing the global RNG too). That seems wrong to me.)\r\n\r\nIn [CRUD.hs](https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana/blob/master/reactive-banana-wx/src/CRUD.hs), Behavior is used to construct the `DatabaseTime` record, which has an associated comment noting its similarity to Discrete. I believe `DatabaseTime` could easily be rewritten in terms of Discrete. It is also used to poll the state of a text box.\r\n\r\nIn [Counter.hs](https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana/blob/master/reactive-banana-wx/src/Counter.hs), no Behaviors are used.\r\n\r\nIn [CurrencyConverter.hs](https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana/blob/master/reactive-banana-wx/src/CurrencyConverter.hs), a single Behavior is used to poll the state of a text box in response to an Event.\r\n\r\nIn [NetMonitor.hs](https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana/blob/master/reactive-banana-wx/src/NetMonitor.hs), a Behavior is used to poll the state of the network in response to an Event.\r\n\r\nIn [TicTacToe.hs](https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana/blob/master/reactive-banana-wx/src/TicTacToe.hs), no Behaviors are used.\r\n\r\nIn [TwoCounter.hs](https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana/blob/master/reactive-banana-wx/src/TwoCounters.hs), a single Behavior is used to track the state of a toggle; it could easily be a Discrete instead.\r\n\r\nIn [Wave.hs](https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana/blob/master/reactive-banana-wx/src/Wave.hs), no Behaviors are used.\r\n\r\nNext I glanced at BlackBoard, which I could only find in the tree of commit b8c353b. It was too large for me to give it a really in-depth examination, but no use of Behaviors that don't fit in one of the above categories (poll cheap state, poll expensive state based on an event, or could easily be Discrete) immediately jumped out to me.\r\n\r\nI took a brief glance at the only other public project using reactive-banana I know of, [Jaek](http://www.tiresiaspress.us/haskell/jaek/), but it was far too large for me to form an accurate impression. I suspect the majority or all of its Behaviors fit in one of the aforementioned categories too, though.\r\n\r\nNow I'll address each category that I've shown Behaviors to be used for separately:\r\n\r\n* **Polling cheap state:** There is probably little downside to using a Discrete here, as the GUI framework will already be updating its mutable state based on the flow of events that change it.\r\n* **Polling expensive state based on an event:** This one is interesting! I am sceptical that all uses of this pattern are valid, like the RNG I mentioned, but certainly the network statistics example seems reasonable. Obviously, the polling of this state could be pushed inside the IO action an Event builds up, but this seems inelegant. Here's an idea: `fromPoll :: Event (IO a) -> NetworkDescription (Event a)`. You could, for instance, write `brandom <- fromPoll $ (randomRIO (0,1) :: IO Double) <$ etick`, and then construct a `Discrete` based on this. A useful combinator might be `fromPollD :: Discrete (IO a) -> NetworkDescription (Discrete a)`. This does reduce modularity to a degree, but from the POV of interfacing with the real world, it's clearer (you control exactly when the possibly-expensive polls will occur), and I think such uses of Behavior are fairly rare anyway.\r\n* **Code that could easily use Discrete:** Well, there's not much to say about this one :)\r\n\r\nSo, why use Behaviors instead of Discrete? Well, an obvious reason is that `changes` exposes more than the abstract interface of a Behavior does. (One could make the same argument about `initial`, but I don't think there's any reason not to offer this function for Behaviors, other than that as an \"implementation detail\", the computation of a Behavior can cause side-effects in reactive-banana.)\r\n\r\nSo here's my proposal:\r\n\r\n* Remove the existing Behavior type.\r\n* In the Implementation flavour, implement Behavior using Discrete. Replace `fromPoll` with the form I suggested above.\r\n* Change the types of `initial` and `changes` as follows:\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\ninitial :: Behavior a -> NetworkDescription a\r\nchanges :: Behavior a -> NetworkDescription (Event a)\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Document these (or at least `changes`) as being intended solely for the use of interfacing to the outside world.\r\n* Reap the benefits of a simplified API, simplified implementation, and vastly simplified programming experience.\r\n\r\nNote that I'm pretty sure that none of the above would involve any changes to the model; Discrete is a perfectly cromulent implementation of the Behavior type family.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, and I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this (for any value of *you* — if you're reading this bug report and use reactive-banana, please speak up!) :)","number":22,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana/issues/22","comments":5,"assignee":null},"comment":{"created_at":"2012-01-01T03:15:55Z","user":{"id":3265,"login":"ehird","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ehird","gravatar_id":"27c2800b367d2a4c4a8958216ebcbe34","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/27c2800b367d2a4c4a8958216ebcbe34?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"updated_at":"2012-01-01T03:15:55Z","id":3323679,"body":"By the way, here is a more formal argument that an RNG cannot be represented properly as a `Behavior Int`:\r\n\r\nLet us consider a `Behavior Int` as a function f : Time → Int, where we'll pretend Time is a real.\r\n\r\nConsider this behaviour:\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nbad :: NetworkDescription (Behavior Int)\r\nbad = do\r\n  var <- newMVar 0\r\n  fromPoll . modifyMVar_ var $ \\(!n) -> (n+1, n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's say we have an FRP implementation that samples a behaviour regularly with timestep *dt*. That is, it computes f(0), then f(*dt*), then f(2*dt*), and so on. First let's set *dt* = 0.5. Sampling of `bad` proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><td>f(0)</td><td>= 0</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>f(0.5)</td><td>= 1</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>f(1)</td><td>= 2</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>f(1.5)</td><td>= 3</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>f(2)</td><td>= 4</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nNow let's try the same thing with *dt* = 0.25:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><td>f(0)</td><td>= 0</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>f(0.25)</td><td>= 1</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>f(0.5)</td><td>= 2</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>f(0.75)</td><td>= 3</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td>f(1)</td><td>= 4</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nOops! We have f(1) = 2, but f(1) = 4. Timestep-independence has been violated; this behaviour is defined entirely by the implementation details acting on it. Sure, it's true that with current systems, we can't avoid having the \"outside world\" pollute the FRP system a bit, but this behaviour is *completely* meaningless — *all* it does is observe the implementation detail of when sampling happens.\r\n\r\nSo how does this differ from an RNG?\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nrng :: NetworkDescription (Behavior Int)\r\nrng = do\r\n  gen <- getStdGen >>= newMVar\r\n  fromPoll . modifyMVar_ gen $ \\(!g) ->\r\n    let (a, g') = random g in (g', a)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only difference here is that the change to the state is more confusing (but no less predictable) than `(+1)`.\r\n\r\nYou could argue that it's best to see an RNG as an *input* to the whole system from the outside world, and so this is legitimate; but, by going back to `bad`, we can see the real problem here: the input is changing, not because of some external influence, and not because of some well-defined FRP behaviour (in the English-language sense), but because of implementation details; the FRP implementation is the entire source of the time-varying behaviour, and so it is not really an input at all.\r\n\r\nYou could also argue that anything you make with `fromPoll` is completely lawless and anything goes. I think this would be a very unfortunate position to take, and also one inconsistent with how we treat programs; a program that used a Behavior's sampling side-effects to control the appearance and functionality of a user-facing GUI would be seen as very bad style indeed.\r\n\r\nHow can we correct this? Well, if we want the FRP system to drive the advancing of the state, why not explicitly express this with the tools it gives us?\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nrng :: Event () -> NetworkDescription (Behavior Int)\r\nrng = ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Event controls when the RNG state is to be advanced, just as the observation of the value did in the previous, broken version. The point of all this is that, although `bad` and `rng` are not behaviours, and incidentally cannot be implemented with my proposal, the new, corrected `rng` *can* be!\r\n\r\n```haskell\r\nrng :: Event () -> NetworkDescription (Behavior Int)\r\nrng tick = do\r\n  (a1, g1) <- getStdGen >>= random\r\n  gen <- newMVar g1\r\n  fromPollB a1 (next gen <$ tick)\r\n  where next gen =\r\n          modifyMVar_ gen $ \\(!g) ->\r\n            let (a, g') = random g in (g', a)\r\n```","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/HeinrichApfelmus/reactive-banana/issues/comments/3323679"},"action":"created"},"actor":{"login":"ehird","id":3265,"url":"https://api.github.dev/users/ehird","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/27c2800b367d2a4c4a8958216ebcbe34?d=http://github.dev%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"27c2800b367d2a4c4a8958216ebcbe34"},"public":true,"id":"1508519886"}

The item can now be dragged to any location\non the applet window, but only ON THE FIRST DRAG. Once released,\nthe item's position is SET and it cannot be MOVED unless the user uses\nAlt+drag.\n\nMini Update: the cursor now works. Item can ONLY be dragged onto\nthe dropCanvas area.\n\nBugs: If the user performs a drag before selecting an item, there will\nbe a NULL POINTER response.

For instance, some of them store things between refresh and other don't.  Some have a \"mark all\" checkbox and some don't.  These are fairly straightforward to implement in each of the versions where it's missing, and I've started on this.\r\n\r\nAnother piece of this that I'm coming across is the third party libraries used by some of these.  I think we should try to figure out a way to standardize which third party plugins should be used.  One example that I think should be removed is things like emberjs using Sassy CSS (scss).  SCSS is interesting and good to use, but I don't think it contributes to the nature of this project.  If it's decided that SCSS is so valuable, then we should be using it on all of the projects and not just one.  Another one of these is javascriptmvc's use of StealJS.  I know that they work together, but it would be great if we weren't using compiled production code for the demo app, and if we could eliminate this from the example completely I think it would help level the playing field between the examples in understandability and size.\r\n\r\nI really want some discussion around this and how other people think this should move forward.","number":45,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/addyosmani/todomvc/issues/45","comments":0,"assignee":null},"action":"opened"},"actor":{"login":"boushley","id":101239,"url":"https://api.github.dev/users/boushley","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d11f4b154a1c6ccc08578a67cc202a71?d=http://github.dev%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"d11f4b154a1c6ccc08578a67cc202a71"},"public":true,"id":"1508520358"}

This information is stored on the *_forum table to keep from having to pull from the posts table each time. However, moderators should be able to view the latest post information, whether for approved or unapproved posts. So what I did was added a new query (yes, I know, a query in a loop == bad, but I couldn't figure out a decent alternative), ONLY when the current user has moderator permissions for the forum in question, that fetches the information about the latest post directly from the posts table.\r\n\r\nI have tested this and it works perfectly fine on my own installation. The only issue I can see is the potential for adding a lot of queries when a user is a global moderator. However, unless someone has a better way (using the current parent query (that creates the loop in which this query is placed), this is how it will have to work.\r\n\r\nhttp://tracker.phpbb.com/browse/PHPBB3-10553","number":523,"commits":1,"_links":{"review_comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/phpbb/phpbb3/pulls/523/comments"},"html":{"href":"https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb3/pull/523"},"self":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/phpbb/phpbb3/pulls/523"},"comments":{"href":"https://api.github.com/repos/phpbb/phpbb3/issues/523/comments"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/phpbb/phpbb3/pulls/523","merged_by":null,"diff_url":"https://github.com/phpbb/phpbb3/pull/523.diff","comments":0,"merged":false,"head":{"user":{"id":217426,"login":"imkingdavid","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imkingdavid","gravatar_id":"6ff786fe638a45d02f8ea2727d7bfda0","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6ff786fe638a45d02f8ea2727d7bfda0?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"ref":"ticket/10553","sha":"94ea8070924188150f47f6ca573784909990e0a1","repo":{"created_at":"2011-07-29T22:53:52Z","open_issues":0,"watchers":1,"git_url":"git://github.com/imkingdavid/phpbb3.git","updated_at":"2012-01-01T03:28:09Z","fork":true,"id":2126731,"language":"PHP","html_url":"https://github.com/imkingdavid/phpbb3","name":"phpbb3","master_branch":"develop","description":" phpBB 3 Development: phpBB is a popular open-source bulletin board written in PHP.

I've killed both app and service, power cycled the phone, and tried in several locations at several times. It shows \"ME\" on the map to about ten feet, and setting the GPS accuracy to 150 didn't help. Minimum signal is set to -99. \r\n\r\nWiGLE works properly on this phone, but your map does seem preferable. \r\n\r\nNot only is my DB empty, trying to open it with the SQLite Browser crashes that tool. It finds two tables and three indexes, and will show me this SQL log _once_ if I request it right away before touching anything else to make it crash:\r\n-----\r\nSELECT name, sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' ;\r\nPRAGMA TABLE_INFO(android_metadata);\r\nPRAGMA TABLE_INFO(networks);\r\nSELECT name, sql FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index' \r\nSELECT rowid, *  FROM android_metadata ORDER BY rowid; \r\n-----\r\n\r\nWell, that may be a fluke - the SQLite Browser doesn't seem to be working even on known good files today.

I analyzed the events and saw that indeed the tap event is fired twice when I click on the text. One event has the span with the text as the source and the other has the span that contains the span with the text as the source.\r\n\r\nThe Tatoo I have is running Android 2.3.3 (cyanogen). The bug does not manifest itself on the emulator (Android 2.2 and 2.3), or on a HTC Desire running android 2.2. I' d like to know if anyone else has encountered the same problem (or a similar problem on other devices). \r\n\r\nI think it has to do with the default android browser. When I test on the Tatoo device with Opera mobile browser the problem does not occur.","number":3340,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3340","comments":1,"assignee":null},"comment":{"created_at":"2012-01-01T03:48:51Z","user":{"id":359929,"login":"toddparker","url":"https://api.github.com/users/toddparker","gravatar_id":"4ec3e17536d217f2367be3aebb72a72b","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ec3e17536d217f2367be3aebb72a72b?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"updated_at":"2012-01-01T03:48:51Z","id":3323734,"body":"Made a jsbin for testing:\r\nhttp://jsbin.com/avibed\r\nhttp://jsbin.com/avibed/edit","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/comments/3323734"},"action":"created"},"actor":{"login":"toddparker","id":359929,"url":"https://api.github.dev/users/toddparker","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4ec3e17536d217f2367be3aebb72a72b?d=http://github.dev%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"4ec3e17536d217f2367be3aebb72a72b"},"public":true,"id":"1508521027"}

The best way would be for you to write short self-contained testcases, then I can work against those and implement that needs to be done so that they each work (they should work ok when compiled to native code, of course, so I have what to compare against).\r\n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/kripken/emscripten/issues/comments/3323740"},"action":"created"},"actor":{"login":"kripken","id":173661,"url":"https://api.github.dev/users/kripken","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cb9f8cd8da97fa3a92e46ebe576e8050?d=http://github.dev%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"cb9f8cd8da97fa3a92e46ebe576e8050"},"public":true,"id":"1508521159"}

Auth stores valid identities in a session variable. An identity is a simple object with two fields, a mapper instance, and an entity. It has two methods, a __get to be able to get any key, and a getIdentifier method which returns the primary key value of the entity.\r\n\r\nSince I need the mapper to get the primaryKey field, the identity needs to store it. When saving the object in the session and the session is shut down, PHP serializes the object. So my Identity gets serialized, which serializes the mapper, which contains a Config object which is serialized, which contains adapters.\r\n\r\nHere is where the problem arises. From what I've read online, PDO cannot be serialized. \r\n\r\nThis is the specific error I get: \"Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'PDOException' with message 'You cannot serialize or unserialize PDO instances' in [no active file]:0 Stack trace: #0 [internal function]: PDO->__sleep() #1 {main} thrown in [no active file] on line 0\"\r\n\r\nAfter doing some research online, I came across a bunch of links, but this one in particular:\r\nhttp://fabien.potencier.org/article/9/php-serialization-stack-traces-and-exceptions\r\n\r\nSo somehow a solution to this problem should be found.\r\n\r\nIn my particular case, I didn't need any of the information from the config to be serialized so I just told \\Spot\\Config to implement \\Serializable\r\n\r\nand added the two functions:\r\n\r\npublic function serialize()\r\n    {\r\n        return serialize(array());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public function unserialize($serialized)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\nJust telling it to not serialize the connections. The error no longer shows up. This is a solution that really only works for me though, as it is not the intended use of Config. I'm not sure what we should really do about it.\r\n","number":7,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/actridge/Spot/issues/7","comments":0,"assignee":null},"action":"opened"},"actor":{"login":"TheSavior","id":249164,"url":"https://api.github.dev/users/TheSavior","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c0b11bdf8daa26df8c7794ea28fef2fd?d=http://github.dev%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"c0b11bdf8daa26df8c7794ea28fef2fd"},"public":true,"id":"1508521205"}
