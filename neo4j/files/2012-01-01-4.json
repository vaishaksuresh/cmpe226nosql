For instance, some of them store things between refresh and other don't.  Some have a \"mark all\" checkbox and some don't.  These are fairly straightforward to implement in each of the versions where it's missing, and I've started on this.\r\n\r\nAnother piece of this that I'm coming across is the third party libraries used by some of these.  I think we should try to figure out a way to standardize which third party plugins should be used.  One example that I think should be removed is things like emberjs using Sassy CSS (scss).  SCSS is interesting and good to use, but I don't think it contributes to the nature of this project.  If it's decided that SCSS is so valuable, then we should be using it on all of the projects and not just one.  Another one of these is javascriptmvc's use of StealJS.  I know that they work together, but it would be great if we weren't using compiled production code for the demo app, and if we could eliminate this from the example completely I think it would help level the playing field between the examples in understandability and size.\r\n\r\nI really want some discussion around this and how other people think this should move forward.","number":45,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/addyosmani/todomvc/issues/45","comments":1,"assignee":null},"comment":{"created_at":"2012-01-01T04:05:45Z","user":{"id":110953,"login":"addyosmani","url":"https://api.github.com/users/addyosmani","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/96270e4c3e5e9806cf7245475c00b275?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","gravatar_id":"96270e4c3e5e9806cf7245475c00b275"},"updated_at":"2012-01-01T04:05:45Z","id":3323762,"body":"All valid points. One of the largest problems we've had is that there's never been a set of specifications written defining exactly what is expected of a 'Todo' application. This has led to some of the applications being written with basic list/add/remove/edit capabilities, but there's little else provided in terms of guidance other than saying 'study one of the other apps and base it off of that'. The obvious problem there is certain visual specs (mark all checkbox etc.) have been omitted in some implementations whilst not in others.\r\n\r\nI agree about us dropping ember's SCSS. Another problem I ran into was trying to decide whether to continue opting for what the official solution was advocating for use (eg. Ember's original todo app that I refactored used SCSS so I assumed developers using it would wish to go for it too), however in hindsight, everything should just be using simple stylesheets instead. \r\n\r\nWhat I see as us needing to do to clean the examples up is:\r\n\r\n* Define what is expected of a typical application\r\n* Identify the apps missing any aspects of these specs\r\n* Working on patching the above\r\n\r\nAnother intention I had had (but never had time for) was creating a basic boilerplate (index/CSS) for a Todo app that could be handed to a framework author or someone working with the framework if they wished to create a 'TodoMVC' compatible example for submission.

I've deleted the image folder and placed it back, cleared the cache on my iPhone, restarted my iPhone and am still having the issue. The issue doesn't show when testing the app in the iPhone simulator.\r\n\r\nI hope that makes some sense. \r\n\r\nThanks for your help. \r\n\r\n\r\nExcuse my messy code, it's a work in

I'm guessing it has to do with byte counting and socket timeouts...\r\n\r\nI have a very small Flask application that looks like the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom flask import Flask, request\r\n\r\napp = Flask(__name__)\r\n\r\n@app.route('/test', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\r\ndef test():\r\n    return '<pre>%r</pre>' % (request.form,)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    app.run(port=5555)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I run the server and then issue two very similar cURL commands against it, I get wildly different response times:\r\n\r\n    tony@quaternion ~/Projects/test/test# time curl -d 'foo=bar' http://localhost:5555/test\r\n    127.0.0.1 - - [03/Nov/2011 12:06:15] \"POST /test HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\r\n    <pre>ImmutableMultiDict([('foo', u'bar')])</pre>\r\n    real\t0m0.009s\r\n    user\t0m0.003s\r\n    sys\t0m0.003s\r\n    tony@quaternion ~/Projects/test/test# time curl -F 'foo=bar' http://localhost:5555/test\r\n    127.0.0.1 - - [03/Nov/2011 12:06:22] \"POST /test HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\r\n    <pre>ImmutableMultiDict([('foo', u'bar')])</pre>\r\n    real\t0m2.009s\r\n    user\t0m0.003s\r\n    sys\t0m0.003s\r\n    tony@quaternion ~/Projects/test/test# \r\n\r\nThe only difference between the two commands (as far as I know...) is that with -d, the data is sent URL-encoded, whereas with -F it's sent as multipart/form-data. I went ahead and ran a trace on it, and what I'm seeing is this:\r\n\r\n     --- modulename: formparser, funcname: _find_terminator\r\n    13.09 formparser.py(303):         for line in iterator:\r\n     --- modulename: wsgi, funcname: make_line_iter\r\n    13.09 wsgi.py(606):     stream = make_limited_stream(stream, limit)\r\n     --- modulename: wsgi, funcname: make_limited_stream\r\n    13.09 wsgi.py(577):     if not isinstance(stream, LimitedStream):\r\n    13.09 wsgi.py(581):     return stream\r\n    13.09 wsgi.py(607):     _read = stream.read\r\n    13.09 wsgi.py(608):     buffer = []\r\n    13.09 wsgi.py(609):     while 1:\r\n    13.09 wsgi.py(610):         if len(buffer) > 1:\r\n    13.09 wsgi.py(617):         chunks = _read(buffer_size).splitlines(True)\r\n     --- modulename: wsgi, funcname: read\r\n    13.09 wsgi.py(773):         if self._pos >= self.limit:\r\n    13.09 wsgi.py(775):         if size is None or size == -1:  # -1 is for consistence with file\r\n    13.09 wsgi.py(777):         to_read = min(self.limit - self._pos, size)\r\n    13.09 wsgi.py(778):         try:\r\n    13.09 wsgi.py(779):             read = self._read(to_read)\r\n     --- modulename: socket, funcname: read\r\n    13.09 socket.py(340):         rbufsize = max(self._rbufsize, self.default_bufsize)\r\n    13.09 socket.py(344):         buf = self._rbuf\r\n    13.09 socket.py(345):         buf.seek(0, 2)  # seek end\r\n    13.09 socket.py(346):         if size < 0:\r\n    13.09 socket.py(362):             buf_len = buf.tell()\r\n    13.09 socket.py(363):             if buf_len >= size:\r\n    13.09 socket.py(371):             self._rbuf = StringIO()  # reset _rbuf.  we consume it via buf.\r\n    13.09 socket.py(372):             while True:\r\n    13.09 socket.py(373):                 left = size - buf_len\r\n    13.09 socket.py(379):                 try:\r\n    13.09 socket.py(380):                     data = self._sock.recv(left)\r\n    14.74 socket.py(385):                 if not data:\r\n    14.74 socket.py(387):                 n = len(data)\r\n    14.74 socket.py(388):                 if n == size and not buf_len:\r\n    14.74 socket.py(394):                     return data\r\n\r\nNotice the ~2 second delay between socket.py lines 380/385. Obviously, the socket is blocking. Althought this is not Werkzeug code (at this point), I'm assuming the problem might have to do with the value of `left` or the initial configuration of the socket.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking, and keep up the great work on Werkzeug/Flask et. al.\r\n\r\n","number":133,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitsuhiko/werkzeug/issues/133","comments":1,"assignee":null},"comment":{"created_at":"2012-01-01T04:27:27Z","user":{"id":344026,"login":"mwhite","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwhite","gravatar_id":"2c31fc1c8efd6d33de3be5b47edb4f2e","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c31fc1c8efd6d33de3be5b47edb4f2e?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png"},"updated_at":"2012-01-01T04:27:27Z","id":3323801,"body":"I have the same issue, except there is a 1-second delay instead of a 2-second delay.","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/mitsuhiko/werkzeug/issues/comments/3323801"},"action":"created"},"actor":{"login":"mwhite","id":344026,"url":"https://api.github.dev/users/mwhite","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c31fc1c8efd6d33de3be5b47edb4f2e?d=http://github.dev%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"2c31fc1c8efd6d33de3be5b47edb4f2e"},"public":true,"id":"1508522244"}

Easy mode will default defence attribute to 0, but when we put on Hard mode for example, we give a -2 penalty as the starting defence attribute. This would mean that enemies will be able to hit more hp off our Character.

I'm thinking of renaming it \"incidental-keywords\" (package nickname \"IKEYWORD\"). Really the main point of this library is to allow one to \"incidentally\" use symbol names that would have traditionally been very clashy, but without the associated mess of symbol conflicts. Sometimes in DSLs you might want to use short, convenient symbol names such as MACRO and whatnot, but this can result in annoying conflicts when you combine libraries. Traditional methods of avoiding this are just using keyword symbols or \"mangling\" the names in various ways (such as using a \"package prefix\" as part of the name), but I don't find these approaches particularly convenient.\r\n\r\nDue to the instability, I'm temporarily withholding the Quicklisp inclusion request.
