The first thing the subroutine\ndid was GetMarcBiblio, and the $biblionumber passed was never used again.\n\nThis subroutine was only used 3 places: opac/opac-search.pl, opac/opac-detail.pl,\nand C4/VirtualShelves/Page.pm.  In the first and last cases, it was used in a loop.\nIn the last two cases, a call to GetMarcBiblio had already been done.  This is expensive, and\nwe were doing it twice per record.\n\nFor opac/opac-search.pl, the call to GetMarcBiblio was moved to just outside GetCOinSBiblio;\nthis will not change the performance at all.  But for opac/opac-detail.pl and C4/VirtualShelves/Page.pm,\na redudant call to GetMarcBiblio is now avoided.\n\nTo Test:\n1. Enable COinSinOPACResults in system preferences.  Perform a search in the OPAC.\n   Verify that the COinS spans are showing up\n2. View the detail record of one of the returned items.  Confirm that the COinS span exists on the detail page.\n3.

It makes deletion time visible.\nIn the past, the marcxml was updated too at that moment, resulting in an\nupdated timestamp in biblioitems too. The timestamp in biblio was not touched.\n\nIf you delete a biblio however, the timestamps in deletedbiblio and\ndeletedbiblioitems do not reflect time of deletion. They still show the time of\nlast update before the record was deleted. This last update can be extracted\nfrom MARC field 005 too.\n\nThis behavior is not consistent nor logical.

not 100% sure of the current state, but previously there was 2 (at least) problems with the Propel testsuite on PostgreSQL.\r\n\r\n 1. Transactions. Propel testsuite runs in an isolated transaction (afaik). In a case of a failed SQL query, the transaction on PostgreSQL is marked as errorneous and any further query will fail as the transaction isn't actually rollbacked as per propels own \"nested transactions\" implementation.\r\n 1. MySQL formatting. The ModelCriteria sql-tests assert against mysql syntax (like $this->assertEquals('SELECT * FROM `foo`', $sql); ) I don't know if this can be \"fixed\". We need to hard code to some SQL syntax.\r\n\r\nWhat I have done, is to run the complete test suite on mysql and run just specific tests against PostgreSQL when dealing with PostgreSQL-specific stuff. The problem with this approach is that I can't run \"regression tests\", as I don't know what my patch has broken on PostgreSQL..\r\n\r\nThis is definitely something we could try address in Propel2, at least..\r\n","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/propelorm/Propel/issues/comments/3323959"},"action":"created"},"actor":{"login":"nnarhinen","id":265438,"url":"https://api.github.dev/users/nnarhinen","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d02ebe57c3f95c5b86ece1a63759e43d?d=http://github.dev%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"d02ebe57c3f95c5b86ece1a63759e43d"},"public":true,"id":"1508526721"}

These days, many of us are writing our applications as collections of multiple engines, with nothing in the central application except what is necessary to load those engines and mount their routes. Devise fails that sort of application in multiple ways. So many ways that it's probably time for the Devise documentation to bear a warning that it doesn't work at present to use Devise from engines.\r\n\r\nDevise internals depend on `ApplicationController`, and Devise installs its methods and helpers in `ApplicationController`. Engine-centric applications are unlikely to contain an `ApplicationController`.\r\n\r\nInstead of installing them in `ApplicationController`, use something like this to install Devise methods and helpers. This installs in both `ActionController::Base` *and* its descendants, as there will be some descendants that have been initialized before Devise:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nActionController::Base.class_eval do\r\n  # Install methods and helpers here.\r\nend\r\nActionController::Base.descendants.each do |klass|\r\n  klass.class_eval do\r\n    # Install methods and helpers here.\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nDevise expects its named routes to live in `main_app`. The only way to tell Devise that the named routes are in an engine's route table is to re-write all of its views by hand.\r\n\r\nDevise expects a root URL handler in `main_app` rather than an engine, and can't fall back if there isn't one. Here's one way to fall back:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmain_app.respond_to?(:root_url) ? main_app.root_url : '/'\r\n'''\r\n\r\nWhen used from a namespaced engine, Devise points all of its routes to controllers in the engine rather than Devise. The only way to turn this off seems to be to define *all* of the controllers used by Devise, just defining :module is insufficient, the result doesn't match the internal controller paths in Devise.","number":1539,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plataformatec/devise/issues/1539","comments":1,"assignee":null},"comment":{"created_at":"2012-01-01T07:20:26Z","user":{"id":9582,"login":"josevalim","url":"https://api.github.com/users/josevalim","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-140.png","gravatar_id":"e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e"},"updated_at":"2012-01-01T07:20:26Z","id":3323976,"body":"Thanks for the detailed report. Some comments to the issues you raised:\r\n\r\n1) About `ApplicationController` and `ActionController::Base`, we have two options. Provide a convenience method that installs helpers in any controller, so one can do:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Engine::ApplicationController\r\n  Devise.install_helpers(self)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr simply adding configuration to ActionController::Base. Adding to ActionController::Base has the side effect of polluting all controllers and, in any case, I don't think we should loop over the descendants. If an engine depends on Devise, it is its job to ensure Devise was loaded before it.\r\n\r\n2) Rewriting the views is a necessary evil and it is fine imho. The views are supposed to be a stub (very similar to scaffold) and you need to touch them anyway.\r\n\r\n3) root_url certainly needs to be fixed\r\n\r\n4) namespace engine issue needs to be fixed as well\r\n\r\nWill you be willing to send patches to solve those issues? I can provide any guidance you need. We want to release Devise 2.0 and I would love if we could make this release work better with Engines, even if we need to cut Rails 3.0 compatibility (only Rails 3.1 forward).","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/plataformatec/devise/issues/comments/3323976"},"action":"created"},"actor":{"login":"josevalim","id":9582,"url":"https://api.github.dev/users/josevalim","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e?d=http://github.dev%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"e837f6b7fd146ab16ed3d663476c063e"},"public":true,"id":"1508527069"}

I noticed that the user interface was one of the areas you had mentioned as an area for improvement, and I had some feedback I wanted to share with you after experimenting with it for a while now. Hopefully these suggestions will be helpful...\r\n\r\nUser Interface:\r\nI found myself wanting to repeatedly generate new maps to see what possibilities would emerge. However having to reopen the menu and retype a new seed each time quickly became tedious.\r\n\r\n* Make the New Map dialog persistent as either a side panel or a floating toolbar\r\n   - eliminates 2 clicks & 3 mouse movements\r\n* Display the Random Seed that was used to create the current map in the New Map dialog\r\n   - allows the user to keep hitting the button to generate a new map while being able to note a seed that produced results they like so they can revisit it later\r\n* A checkbox to keep the currently displayed seed, or to randomize a new one\r\n   - gives the user the ability to reset the current map\r\n   - allows randomizing without having to clear the Random Seed box\r\n* A checkbox to automatically increment the current Random Seed when the New Map button is pressed\r\n   - works when the suggested keep Random Seed option is checked\r\n   - the user could keep generating new maps in a methodical fashion\r\n\r\nHappy New Year and hope to hear back from you.
