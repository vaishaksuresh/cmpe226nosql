That works perfectly, except that if you do not add a callback for the load functions that will process all nodes, then you cannot easily set the user_data pointer for values (for elements, this can be done in the callback for setting the data type).\r\n\r\nHaving both a context pointer and adding a callback to touch each node is really the only way to have a C++ wrapper for any node type that has a back pointer to the main document (at least, from what I know from your code).\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what I mean:\r\n\r\nmxml_node_t * /* O - First node or NULL if the file could not be read. */\r\nmxmlLoadFile(mxml_node_t    *top, /* I - Top node */\r\n             FILE           *fp, /* I - File to read from */\r\n             mxml_load_cb_t cb, /* I - Callback function or MXML_NO_CALLBACK */\r\n             mxml_process_node_cb_t process_node_cb, /* I - Process node callback function or MXML_NO_CALLBACK */\r\n             void *process_node_context  /* I - Process node context pointer */\r\n             )\r\n\r\nThe process_node_cb is called for all elements and values, and can be used to set the user_data field for process_node_context.  The only other alternative for setting value user_data is to re-walk the entire document and set the user_data in the second pass.  This seems really inefficient when the extra callback solves the problem so smoothly.","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/michaelrsweet/Mini-XML/issues/comments/3324041"},"action":"created"},"actor":{"login":"michaelrsweet","id":488103,"url":"https://api.github.dev/users/michaelrsweet","avatar_url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2daeb0c57e7f61fe81706928130cd07d?d=http://github.dev%2Fimages%2Fgravatars%2Fgravatar-user-420.png","gravatar_id":"2daeb0c57e7f61fe81706928130cd07d"},"public":true,"id":"1508528483"}

It should build on other platforms without changes, the *.pro files are supposed to take care of that.\r\n\r\n- Factored out the MSVC stanza into a single \"common.pro\" file. This gets included by the other qmake project files.\r\n- This would also be a good place to set (rsp factor out) global, common project definitions.\r\n- The emu_*.cpp and emu_*.h files are only added to SOURCES and HEADERS when needed; this is done in src/src.pro.\r\n- Added some messages that qmake emits when MSVC or older (or too old) Qt is detected and accomodated.\r\n- To silence these messages, remove \"verbose\" option from CONFIG variable in src/src.pro.\r\n\r\nIf it works like I hope it does, you should be able to build via qmake without further intervention. And none of the emu_* stuff should find its way into the makefiles.\r\n\r\n(Somehow this curious spanish-named folder popped up during me wrestling with git. I deleted it again, hope that doesn't cause troubles for the pull.
